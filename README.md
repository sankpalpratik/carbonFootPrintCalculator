Repository for TY. B.Sc (Computer Science) project of Carbon Footprint Calculator using Java.
Carbon footprint is a major issue right now and to tackle any problem, we need a strong and precise database. Unfortunately the existing database of carbon footprint is not very precise. In addition to this, as there is nothing to address small number of people, there is no awareness regarding this among people. There is a need for automated software which can collect large data, store it and process it to evaluate the carbon footprint of each individual and accordingly provide solutions.
The project is a GUI based interactive software which can be installed on any compatible desktop/laptop. It is user-friendly and can be easily handled by any user. The representatives are allocated with an area, where they conduct a survey and collect census data from each citizen in that area. Along with the census data, the representative also collects the carbon footprint data as input to the software and stores it into a database. The software then calculates and processes this data and evaluates the total carbon footprint of each individual of the family/group of people. Then according to the evaluation generated, the software interpretes solutions to reduce carbon footprint emissions.
